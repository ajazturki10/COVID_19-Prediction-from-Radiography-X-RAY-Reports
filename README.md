Contribution

We have developed the database of COVID-19 x-ray images from the Italian Society of Medical and Interventional Radiology (SIRM) COVID-19 DATABASE [1], Novel Corona Virus 2019 Dataset developed by Joseph Paul Cohen and Paul Morrison, and Lan Dao in GitHub [2] and images extracted from 43 different publications. References of each image are provided in the metadata. Normal and Viral pneumonia images were adopted from the Chest X-Ray Images (pneumonia) database [3].
Image Formats
All the images are in Portable Network Graphics (PNG) file format and the resolution are 299*299 pixels.
Objective
Researchers can use this database to produce useful and impactful scholarly work on COVID-19, which can help in tackling this pandemic.

Acknowledgments
Thanks to the Italian Society of Medical and Interventional Radiology (SIRM) for publicly providing the COVID-19 Chest X-Ray dataset [3], Valencia Region Image Bank (BIMCV) padchest dataset [1] and would like to thank J. P. Cohen for taking the initiative to gather images from articles and online resources [5]. Finally to the Chest X-Ray Images (pneumonia) database in Kaggle and Radiological Society of North America (RSNA) Kaggle database for making a wonderful X-ray database for normal, lung opacity, viral, and bacterial pneumonia images [8-9]. Also, a big thanks to our collaborators!
